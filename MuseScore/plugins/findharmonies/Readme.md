Note: screenshot above also includes the names of each individual notes via the notenames plugin I also modified, also in this repo [here](https://github.com/andresn/standard-notation-experiments/edit/master/MuseScore/plugins/notenames/).

Adds basic chord names (where harmonies are found) above the staff via [MuseScore](http://musescore.org/). Also includes inverse position of the chord as a superscript. Handy, for instance, after importing a song from a midi file and having MuseScore transcribe it to standard notation.

Here's how to install a plugin in MuseScore (Mac). NOTE: MuseScore 2.0 and above only supports .qml files:
