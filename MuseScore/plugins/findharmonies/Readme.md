<h1>Find Harmonies</h1>

Adds basic chord names (where harmonies are found) above the staff via [MuseScore](http://musescore.org/). Also includes inverse position of the chord as a superscript. Handy, for instance, after importing a song from a midi file and having MuseScore transcribe it to standard notation.

NOTE: MuseScore above 2.0 only supports .qml files when installing plugins.

<h3>For MuseScore 1.3</h3>

NOTE: screenshot above also includes the names of each individual notes via the notenames plugin I also modified, also in this repo [here](https://github.com/andresn/standard-notation-experiments/edit/master/MuseScore/plugins/notenames/).

NOTE: This only works for Musescore 1.3 and below. Also, color and note formatting works for only MuseScore 1.3 and below.

<h4>To install plugin:</h4>

<h5>Mac</h5>
On Mac OS X, MuseScore looks for plugins in the MuseScore bundle in /Applications/MuseScore.app/Contents/Resources/plugins and in ~/Library/Application Support/MusE/MuseScore/plugins. To be able to move files in the app bundle, right click (Control-click) on MuseScore.app and choose "Show package contents" to reveal the Contents directory. Be careful to use Contents/Resources/plugins and not Contents/plugins.

<h5>Windows</h5>
MuseScore looks for plugins in %ProgramFiles%\MuseScore\Plugins (resp. %ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore\Plugins for the 64-bit versions) and in %LOCALAPPDATA%\MusE\MuseScore\plugins on Vista and Seven or C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Local Settings\Application Data\MusE\MuseScore\plugins (adjusted to your language version) on XP.

<h5>Linux</h5>
In Linux, MuseScore looks for plugins in /usr/share/mscore-1.2/plugins and in ~/.local/share/data/MusE/MuseScore/plugins.
In any of the above cases, restart MuseScore to allow the new plugin(s) to load.
In MuseScore 2.0+ the plugin then needs to get enabled in Menu -> Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins, followed by another restart.
Prior to MuseScore 2.0 a score needs to be open for the Plugins menu to become available.

Plugin's original instructions (retrieved on 11/2014 for MusesScore 1.3):
To use the plugin, you must first install it according to the [instructions in the Handbook] (https://web.archive.org/web/20141224083216/http://musescore.org/en/handbook/plugins)
